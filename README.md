# Weather App

Welcome to the Weather App! This project offers a simple interface to fetch and display a 5-day weather forecast for any city. Input your city name and get instant weather updates. Stay informed with ease!

## Set Up Guide

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed and configured:

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **VSCode or your preferred code editor**: You'll need a code editor to work on the project. We recommend using VSCode, which you can download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but feel free to use your preferred editor.

3. **OpenWeather API Key**: Sign up for an account on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) to get an API key (also known as an APP ID). This key is required to access weather data. Once you have your API key, you're ready to go!

With these prerequisites in place, you're all set to start working on the project. Happy coding!
